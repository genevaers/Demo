## Do you own processing in GenevaERS

When you have run the Demo and seen what GenevaERS can do, the next step is configure your own processing.

The way to do that is in a part of GenevaERS called the Workbench.  You will be able to see how the Demo was configured, and then configure your own processing.

To download and run the Workbench, see [GenevaERS workbench doco](https://genevaers.github.io/wb/).
