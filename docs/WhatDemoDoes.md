# What the GenevaERS Performance Engine Demo does

-----
## Demo Overview

A business might have several large files listing order items, and reference files containing information on orders, products, stores and customers.

Typical reports that might be created from this data are, for example:

All orders including customer and product details.
A summary of all orders by customer.
A summary of all orders by customer, and by store location.
A summary of products sold, by store location.

This demo will generate data of this structure, then using the GenervaERS Performace Engine, generate multiple reports, while only reading the data once.
