# What the Demo does

## Processing

This demo contains dummy data about an example business.

The business has several large order item files, and separate reference files for orders, products, stores and customers.

This demo creates reports for:

- All orders including customer and product details.
- A summary of all orders by customer.
- A summary of all orders by customer, and by store location.
- A summary of products sold, by store location.

This demo creates the above reports by reading all the data only once (rather than each report re-reading a lot of the data).  This is why GenevaERS is called the "Single-Pass Optimization Engine" - all input data is read only once.

The reports are predefined for this demo.  If you follow the instructions in "Install the Demo" you will get the reports.

When you have run the demo and want to try your own processing in GenevaERS, see topic [After the demo](AfterDemo.md).
